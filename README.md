Using your favorite command line, call into the folder.
Run your python interpreter on game.py (e.g. 'python game.py' or 'python3 game.py')

## Having said that...
This is NOT a user friendly minesweeper.
First, the game is run in the command line.
	There's no GUI.
Second, the game does not accept cursor input.
	To click or flag, the user must type 'c' or 'f'.
Third, there's no timer.
	No sense of improvement, urgency, or competition.
